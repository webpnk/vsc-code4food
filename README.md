# Code4Food - Virtual Pet Extension

Feed your virtual pet by coding! This fun VS Code extension adds a virtual pet to your status bar that you can feed by writing code.

## Features

- **Virtual Pet Companion**: Choose from a variety of pets including dogs, cats, dinosaurs, and more!
- **Dynamic Status Bar**: Your pet's status is always visible in the status bar, showing their name and hunger level
- **Feed by Coding**: Your pet gets fed automatically as you type code
- **Multiple Pets**: Adopt multiple pets and switch between them
- **Pet Interactions**: Click on your pet to hear them speak with unique phrases for each type
- **Hunger System**: Code to keep it from dying!

## How it Works

1. **Adopt a Pet**: Use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "Adopt New Pet"
2. **Feed Your Pet**: 
   - Type code to automatically feed your pet
   - Every character you type contributes to your pet's satiety
   - Watch the status bar to monitor your pet's hunger level

3. **Pet States**:
   - 🟢 Full (80-100%)
   - 🟡 OK (60-80%)
   - 🟠 Peckish (40-60%)
   - 🔴 Hungry (20-40%)
   - 🟣 Starving (0-20%)

4. **Interact with Your Pet**:
   - Click on your pet in the status bar to hear them speak
   - Switch between pets using the "Switch Active Pet" command
   - Keep coding to keep them well-fed and happy!
